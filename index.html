<p><b style="font-size: 30px;color:rgb(0, 253, 232)">Origin of the Skakiru Clan</b><br>
The Skakiru Clan traces its roots back over a thousand years to the Hidden Eastern Mountains, where ancient mystics mastered the balance of shadow and light. Founded by the enigmatic warrior-monk Raikun, the clan was built on the principles of stealth, intelligence, and spiritual discipline. Skakiru members were both feared and respected as silent guardians who intervened only when balance was threatened.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 30px;color:rgb(0, 253, 232)">Skakiru Code of Shadows</b><br>
The Skakiru live by a strict code known as the <i>"Tenets of the Veil."</i> These tenets emphasize loyalty to the clan, mastery over emotion, and the pursuit of inner clarity. Violence is never the first option, but when used, it is swift, precise, and absolute. The code forbids unnecessary attachments and requires members to train in both physical combat and mental acuity from childhood.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 30px; color:rgb(0, 253, 232)">Techniques of the Skakiru</b><br>
Skakiru warriors are trained in unique and secretive techniques such as <i>Silent Pulse</i>, a form of motionless movement, and <i>Echo Veil</i>, a mental skill that allows temporary confusion of enemy perception. Advanced members can harness <i>Ether Flow</i>, an energy manipulation technique that channels the user's life force to empower weapons or shield allies.</p>

<p><b style="font-size: 30px; color:rgb(0, 253, 232)">Modern Day Skakiru</b><br>
Though many believe the Skakiru Clan has faded into myth, evidence suggests they have simply adapted to modern times. Rumors tell of Skakiru agents operating as cybersecurity experts, elite spies, or even spiritual mentors in remote corners of the world. Their legacy continues, hidden in plain sightâ€”watching, waiting, and protecting the balance from the shadows.</p>
